        Marcie is originally from Southern California where she gained a strong
        love of the beach - in fact, it’s her favorite place! She also loves to
        garden, is a food connoisseur, and spends all of her time making shaved
        ice! Marcie loves pomegranate, cherry and tigers blood, ESPECIALLY the
        natural tigers blood and natural cherry \

        Aubrey is her daughter and is originally from Pleasant Grove! She has lived here her whole life. She is on the ballroom team at her high school, the mountain biking team and loves to spend time with her friends! A fun fact about Aubrey is that last summer she dyed the ends of her hair with the grape snow cone flavoring and she still has a bit of that coloring that never came out  When she was trying to decide her favorite snow cone flavor, she realized there are just too many and she can’t choose her favorite.

### Shade-grown coffee
Coffee is a small tree or shrub that grows in the forest understory in its wild form, and traditionally was grown commercially under other trees that provided shade. The forest-like structure of shade coffee farms provides habitat for a great number of migratory and resident species.

### Single origin
Single-origin coffee is coffee grown within a single known geographic origin. Sometimes, this is a single farm or a specific collection of beans from a single country. The name of the coffee is then usually the place it was grown to whatever degree available.

### Sustainable farming
Sustainable agriculture is farming in sustainable ways based on an understanding of ecosystem services, the study of relationships between organisms and their environment. What grows where and how it is grown are a matter of choice and careful consideration for nature and communities.

### Direct sourcing
Direct trade is a form of sourcing practiced by some coffee roasters. Advocates of direct trade practices promote direct communication and price negotiation between buyer and farmer, along with systems that encourage and incentivize quality.

### Reinvest profits
We want to truly empower the communities that bring amazing coffee to you. That’s why we reinvest 20% of our profits into farms, local businesses and schools everywhere our coffee is grown. You can see the communities grow and learn more about coffee farming on our blog.
