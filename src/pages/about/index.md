        Marcie is originally from Southern California where she gained a strong
        love of the beach - in fact, it’s her favorite place! She also loves to
        garden and is a food connoisseur.  Her favorite shave ice flavors are
        pomegranate, cherry and tigers blood, ESPECIALLY the natural tigers
        blood and natural cherry \

        Aubrey is her daughter and is originally from Pleasant Grove! She has lived here her whole life. She is on the high school ballroom team and the mountain biking team. She loves to spend time with her friends! A fun fact about Aubrey is that last summer she dyed the ends of her hair with the grape snow cone flavoring and she still has a bit of that coloring that never came out  When she was trying to decide her favorite snow cone flavor, she realized there are just too many and she can’t choose her favorite.
