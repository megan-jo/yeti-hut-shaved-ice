        Marcie is originally from Southern California where she gained a strong
        love of the beach - in fact, it’s her favorite place! She also loves to
        garden, is a food connoisseur, and spends all of her time making shaved
        ice! Marcie loves pomegranate, cherry and tigers blood, ESPECIALLY the
        natural tigers blood and natural cherry \

        Aubrey is her daughter and is originally from Pleasant Grove! She has lived here her whole life. She is on the ballroom team at her high school, the mountain biking team and loves to spend time with her friends! A fun fact about Aubrey is that last summer she dyed the ends of her hair with the grape snow cone flavoring and she still has a bit of that coloring that never came out  When she was trying to decide her favorite snow cone flavor, she realized there are just too many and she can’t choose her favorite.

**Here is our story about the Yeti Hut Shaved Ice Shack:** 

The shack was purchased by Marcie Harmon as a way to bond more with her daugher, Aubrey. Aubrey LOVES snowcones and has always wanted to have a business with snowcones. When Marcie purchased it, Aubrey was so excited! And we all carry that enthusiasm. Getting to work in a snowcone shack in the summer is bascially a high school dream! We love getting to know our customers and making you happy through a yummy snowcone! Hopefully, when you come to get a snowcone you can feel of that enthusiasm. Come in and try it out!!
