## Yeti Hut Job Application

##### At The Yeti Hut we are committed to providing superior quality shaved ice and unparalleled customer service. We are looking for employees who love interacting with people, are eager to work when they are needed, like to keep things clean, and who are reliable and hard working. Although this job is fun, it's not easy.

##### Applicants are less likely to be considered for employment if parents talk to us about it, rather than you, the applicant. Talking to us yourself shows that you really want the job.

##### Our application is closed for the 2021 season. We are fully staffed and do not expect to hire any more for this year. If you would like to apply for the 2022 season, we will start accepting applications in March. An application link will show up on this page. Check back at that time.

##### Thank You!
